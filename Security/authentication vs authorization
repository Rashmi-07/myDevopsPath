Authentication and authorization are two fundamental concepts in the field of computer security and access control. While they are closely related, they serve distinct purposes:

Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that the claimed identity of an individual or system is valid and trustworthy. Authentication answers the question, "Who are you?" It establishes the identity of a user by validating credentials such as usernames, passwords, certificates, or biometric data.

Key points about authentication:

It verifies the identity of a user or system.
It typically involves the use of credentials to establish identity.
It ensures that users are who they claim to be before granting access.
Common authentication methods include username/password, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and biometric authentication.

Authorization:
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the authenticated user's privileges. It determines whether a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain operations or access particular data within an application or system. Authorization answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

Key points about authorization:

It determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access.
It is based on the authenticated user's privileges or permissions.
It controls access to specific features, functions, or data.
Authorization is commonly implemented through role-based access control (RBAC) or permissions-based systems.
To summarize, authentication verifies the identity of a user or entity, while authorization controls what actions or resources that authenticated user is allowed to access. Both authentication and authorization work together to ensure secure access to systems and protect sensitive information.
